      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>The Civil Rights Movement was not only a political and social struggle but also a deeply religious one. Black churches served as organizing hubs, providing meeting spaces, moral guidance through sermons, and inspiration through gospel music. Leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. used theological arguments—drawing on the Bible, Christian ethics, and historic religious precedents—to justify civil disobedience and galvanize mass support.</p>
      <p>This site presents an interactive timeline of pivotal events, a gallery of powerful imagery, and curated primary and secondary sources to showcase the indispensable role faith played in shaping laws, public opinion, and grassroots activism.</p>
